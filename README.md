# Salary prediction model
The salary prediction model that is built by Machine Learning sturcture in kaggle competition
<br>
<u> we are two-man team and 3rd winner in this competition. </u>

## feature engineering
there are many feature to manipulate.<br>
dataset has user's profile such as age, sex, education, major, etc.<br>
The mainly engineering methods are feature selection, generation and PCA(dimenstion reduction).

## modeling 
we used two model to contribute ensemble model, Catboost and LightGBM.<br>
especially, CatBoostRegressor is well in processing nominal variable and predicting numeric variable.<br>
LightGBM is Gradient Boost Model that has more speed to train.<br>
[single model] folder is consist of 5 catboost model that would be trained from different preprocessed dataset.<br>
â€» In our knowledge, Catboost model showed best performance is this dataset.

## stacking
we conjucated contributing 10 models to ensemble with stacking method. <br>
catboost and LGBM model of each Model A ~ B were used to prediction.<br>
for buling stacking model with our results, we used LinearRegressor to predict final result.<br>
we set ridge 1.0. finally, we completed sucessful result!


### ðŸ›‘ Notice ðŸ›‘
There are no datasets to use because of users privacy issue. <br>
but you can check all the process from preprocessing to prediction.
